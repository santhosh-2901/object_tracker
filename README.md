MacV Object Tracker Task
Overview
The MacV Object Tracker Task is a project focused on object detection and tracking in video feeds. It leverages state-of-the-art models and algorithms to identify objects, assign unique IDs, track their movements, and measure metrics such as the total time spent in the video frame by each object. Additionally, the project generates a comprehensive HTML report summarizing the results and includes the processed video.

Objective
To develop an object tracking system capable of:
•	Detecting objects in video frames using YOLOv8.
•	Tracking objects consistently with unique IDs using DeepSORT.
•	Calculating metrics such as total time spent by objects in the video.
•	Visualizing the processed results in the form of bounding boxes, centroids, trails, and timestamps.
•	Generating an HTML report with detailed metrics and embedding the processed video.
